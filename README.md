# AssistMe-virtual-Assistant
AssistMe is a virtual assistant web app that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs simple tasks like fetching live weather data via OpenWeatherMap API, telling the time, or opening websites based on user commands. I implemented command parsing with JavaScript conditionals, used fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval, and DOM manipulation for dynamic responses. The project helped me strengthen my API integration skills, front-end scripting, and learn how to build interactive web interfaces.
